        <h2>What is Buddhism?</h2>
        <p>Buddhism is a path of practice and spiritual development leading to Insight into the true nature of reality. 
            Buddhist practices like meditation are means of changing yourself in order to develop the qualities of awareness, 
            kindness, and wisdom. The experience developed within the Buddhist tradition over thousands of years has created an 
            incomparable resource for all those who wish to follow a path — a path which ultimately culminates in Enlightenment or 
            Buddhahood. An enlightened being sees the nature of reality absolutely clearly, just as it is, and lives fully and naturally 
            in accordance with that vision. This is the goal of the Buddhist spiritual life, representing the end of suffering for anyone 
            who attains it.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Because Buddhism does not include the idea of worshipping a creator god, some people do not see it as a religion in the normal, 
            Western sense. The basic tenets of Buddhist teaching are straightforward and practical: nothing is fixed or permanent; 
            actions have consequences; change is possible. So Buddhism addresses itself to all people irrespective of race, nationality, 
            caste, sexuality, or gender. It teaches practical methods which enable people to realise and use its teachings in order to
             transform their experience, to be fully responsible for their lives.</p>

        <h2>Who was the Buddha?</h2>
        <p>Buddhism started with the Buddha. The word ‘Buddha’ is a title, which means ‘one who is awake’ — in the sense of having
             ‘woken up to reality’. The Buddha was born as Siddhartha Gautama in Nepal around 2,500 years ago. He did not claim 
             to be a god or a prophet. He was a human being who became Enlightened, 
             understanding life in the deepest way possible.</p>
             <br>
        <p>Siddhartha was born into the royal family of a small kingdom on the Indian-Nepalese border. 
            According to the traditional story he had a privileged upbringing, but was jolted out of his sheltered life on 
            realising that life includes the harsh facts of old age, sickness, and death.</p>
            <br>
        <p>This prompted him to puzzle over the meaning of life. Eventually he felt impelled to leave his palace and follow 
            the traditional Indian path of the wandering holy man, a seeker after Truth. He became very adept at meditation 
            under various teachers, and then took up ascetic practices. This was based on the belief that one could free the spirit 
            by denying the flesh. He practised austerities so determinedly that he almost starved to death.</p>

        <h2>What is meditation?</h2>
        <p>There are many things in life that are beyond our control. However, it is possible to take responsibility for and to 
            change one’s state of mind. According to Buddhism this is the most important thing we can do, and Buddhism teaches that 
            it is the only real antidote to the anxiety, hatred, discontentedness, sleepiness, and confusion that beset the human condition.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Meditation is a means of transforming the mind. Buddhist meditation practices are techniques that encourage and develop 
            concentration, clarity, emotional positivity, and a clear seeing of the true nature of things. By engaging with a particular 
            meditation practice one learns the patterns and habits of the mind, and the practice offers a means to cultivate new, more 
            positive ways of being. With discipline and patience these calm and focused states of mind can deepen into profoundly tranquil 
            and energised states of mind. Such experiences can have a transformative effect and can lead to a new understanding of life.</p>
